# Setty Roadmap

## 0.1.0

- Provide interfaces and implementations proving concept is sound and works

## 0.2.0

> Everything from this point is contingent on the release of 0.1.0 being a success

- Refactor `Setty\Builder\SettyEnumValueBuilder` too allow more user control and configuration over the created `\Setty\EnumValue` objects
- Sandbox the use of `eval()` to make the libraries use of this construct to be safer

## 0.3.0

- Add an event layer system onto Setty to allow userland code the ability to plugin to the generation of Setty objects.

## Too far to tell

*Nothing yet*
